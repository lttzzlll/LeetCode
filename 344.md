### [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)


### String, Two Pointer

```Python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s):
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            t = s[l]
            s[l] = s[r]
            s[r] = t
            l += 1
            r -= 1
```

就是数组反转元素.
